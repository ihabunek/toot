.. warning::

    There used to be an **APT package repository** at `bezdomni.net`, managed by
    myself. Since toot is now available in the Debian and Ubuntu repos, the repo
    is no longer required and will be removed soon.

    If you have previously added the repository, remove it by deleting the file
    at: ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bezdomni.list``.
